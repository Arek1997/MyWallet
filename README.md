## Project Overview 🎉

Application to wallet manage.
I would like to point out that this project **ISN'T RESPONSIVE**, that wasn't the goal.
I suggest watching it on a computer monitor.

Main goal was practice JS skill, so whole JS logic file is mine, layout is from course.
I added also nice fade in / fade out animation to avoid raw style.

## Tech/framework used 🔧
